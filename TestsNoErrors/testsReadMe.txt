test1 - similar to the course test, but with macro in the as file, the am file is the same as the course booklet ending example, therefore the output is the same.
test2- similar to 1 but with data mixed, and not at the end and also longer macro, the target is  to see that it works when mixed
test3 - complex test with many lines and options i broke it apart and followed manually seems to work great.
